At this point I really just added examples of how to move the fiber to the left and the right
with both stages moving at the same time so that the fiber isn't being pulled anymore that it
already was pulled initially

These will have to be changed when we actually start pulling the fibers and see what we actually need
to do to get the pulling down correctly
